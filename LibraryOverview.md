# Library Overview
## What library
NumPy for Python
## What purpose does it serve
Python is a language that offers ease of use, at the expense of memory management. It can run slowly when working with vast amounts of data.

NumPy is a library that is programmed in Python, C, and C++. This way, there are the memory management benefits of C, along with the ease of use from Python. To use it, you need to import it to your program, and create a np array. From there, you can do so much more than what Python would normally allow.

This includes getting the indexes of every element in an array that fulfills a condition (can also be returned as a flattened array index), indexing a >1D array using a flattened index, Using an array of indexes on an array to get an array of corresponding elements, multiplying two arrays together. multiply, add, subtract, or divide every element in an array by a scalar value, creating arrays of any size containing random numbers of a specified range, and more.

## Why NumPy
I chose this library because with languages like javascript and numpy, I can sometimes feel a little disconnected from what is actually happening in the computer, like there are fewer ways to get creative when trying to find the solution to a problem. Numpy provides a wide variety of functionality to arrays that lets you get creative and consise when solving issues.
